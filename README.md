# RageMp Rp Server
I was creating this rp server as a way of practicing and learning javascript. I've enrolled in a web development class and decided to stop working on this project.
With that said, I'll be leaving it open source for anyone who wants to build on it instead of starting from scratch. there's not much in the game, but it's something to work with. Cheers!

SN: I would provide the name and logo I was going to use for the game, but those are my personal property I created, copyrighted under my legal name Tevin Campbell. So, therefore, should NOT be used in any shape or form by anyone.
